####Before:
Before kicking off work I setup my environment, Im using a fresh install of windows using WSL. I setup Ruby on the instance
and configured Rubymine, setup RuboCop and then read the rest of spec, 

Stand out requirements for me are that is _should_ remain a command line application, despite my first instinct to create a little
rails app that you upload the file to like **Big Tines**. I could host it neatly on a github deploy, but the spec is very specific.
